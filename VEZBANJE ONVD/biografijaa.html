        <h2>Biography</h2>

        From a young age when he was just 7 years old he found himself wanting to play handball, and all
        the way too his 17th year he was following that passion but sadly injuries got in the way.

        He went on to follow his other passions which was programing and he has been into programing
        since he was a little kid and got his first computer.</p>
        <p> He was always fascinated by technology and
        it's wonders so he always wanted to get involved and learn something about it (even if it was fixing
        his grandparents's TV, he just had to plug a cable in).</p>
        <p>
                Most Summmers he'd spend at work or at parties and when it was off season he would go to school
                and work out. Gym is his getaway place where he does nothing and just lifts weights and listens
                to hardcore psytrance.

            Obviously his family goes on way more than just his closest ones but the writer was too tired to continue
            because he has already writen too much.
